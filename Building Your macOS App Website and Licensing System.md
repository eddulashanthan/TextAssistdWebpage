### **Building Your macOS App Website and Licensing System**

This guide outlines the steps to create a website for your macOS app, handle user accounts, process payments, and implement a secure license key system using free services.  
**1\. Understanding the Architecture**  
You'll be building a multi-part system:

* **Frontend Website:** The user-facing part (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) hosted on Vercel. This is where users learn about your app, download it, sign up, log in, and purchase licenses.  
* **Backend (Serverless Functions):** Code running on Vercel that handles user authentication, interacts with your database, processes payments, generates and validates licenses, and provides API endpoints for your macOS app.  
* **Database:** Stores user data, license keys, transaction records, and license usage. We'll use Supabase for this.  
* **Payment Gateways:** Stripe and PayPal handle the actual money transactions.  
* **macOS App:** Your application, modified to communicate with your backend for license validation and usage reporting.

**Tools We'll Use (Free Tiers):**

* **GitHub:** For hosting your code repository.  
* **Vercel:** For hosting your website and running serverless backend functions.  
* **Supabase:** For your database and user authentication.  
* **Stripe & PayPal:** For payment processing.

**2\. Setting up Your Development Environment**  
You have VS Code and GitHub Copilot, which are excellent tools. You'll also need:

* **Node.js:** Install Node.js (includes npm or yarn) to develop your Vercel serverless functions and potentially your frontend. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).  
* **Git:** For version control with GitHub. It's usually pre-installed on macOS, but ensure it's set up.

**3\. Code Hosting with GitHub**

* Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and create a new, empty public or private repository (private is recommended for commercial projects).  
* Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone \[your-repo-url\]  
* This repository will hold all your website code (frontend and Vercel functions).

**4\. Website and Backend Hosting with Vercel**  
Vercel connects directly to your GitHub repository and deploys your code automatically.

* Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and sign up using your GitHub account.  
* In the Vercel dashboard, click "Add New..." \-\> "Project".  
* Select "Import Git Repository" and choose the repository you created on GitHub.  
* Vercel will detect your project type. For a simple setup, you can often accept the default settings. If you're using a framework like Next.js, Vercel has optimized defaults.  
* Click "Deploy". Vercel will build and deploy your project, giving you a public URL. Any changes pushed to your main branch (e.g., main or master) on GitHub will trigger a new deployment.

**Vercel Serverless Functions:** These are key for your backend logic. In a standard Vercel project structure, you can create an api directory at the root of your project. Any files in this directory (e.g., api/login.js, api/validate-license.js) will automatically become serverless functions accessible via /api/login, /api/validate-license, etc.  
**5\. Database and Authentication with Supabase**  
Supabase provides a robust PostgreSQL database and built-in authentication features.

* Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and sign up.  
* Create a new project. Choose a strong database password and a region.  
* **Database Schema:** Design your tables. Go to the "Table Editor" or "SQL Editor" in the Supabase dashboard. Create the following tables:  
  * users: Supabase Auth will manage core user data here. You might link to a profiles table for additional user info if needed.  
  * licenses:  
    * id (UUID, Primary Key, Default: uuid\_generate\_v4())  
    * key (TEXT, Unique) \- Your generated license key.  
    * user\_id (UUID, Foreign Key \-\> users.id) \- Links to the purchasing user.  
    * hours\_purchased (INT) \- Total hours bought (5, 10, or 20).  
    * hours\_remaining (NUMERIC) \- Track remaining time, can be decremented.  
    * purchase\_date (TIMESTAMPZ, Default: now())  
    * last\_validated (TIMESTAMPZ) \- Last time the license was validated by a system.  
    * linked\_system\_id (TEXT) \- Stores the unique identifier of the first system to validate this license.  
    * status (TEXT, Default: 'active') \- e.g., 'active', 'expired', 'revoked'.  
  * transactions:  
    * id (UUID, Primary Key, Default: uuid\_generate\_v4())  
    * user\_id (UUID, Foreign Key \-\> users.id)  
    * license\_id (UUID, Foreign Key \-\> licenses.id) \- Links to the license issued.  
    * payment\_gateway (TEXT) \- 'stripe' or 'paypal'.  
    * transaction\_id (TEXT) \- The ID from Stripe/PayPal.  
    * amount (NUMERIC)  
    * currency (TEXT)  
    * status (TEXT) \- e.g., 'completed', 'failed', 'pending'.  
    * created\_at (TIMESTAMPZ, Default: now())  
* **Supabase Authentication:** In the "Authentication" section, enable the sign-in methods you want (Email, Google, etc.). Supabase handles user registration, login, and session management.  
* **Row Level Security (RLS):** This is CRITICAL for database security. Enable RLS for your licenses and transactions tables and write policies to ensure users can only read their own records and cannot modify sensitive data like hours\_remaining directly from the frontend. Supabase documentation has detailed guides on RLS.

**6\. Implementing Backend Logic (Vercel Functions)**  
Create files in your api directory on Vercel to handle these tasks:

* **api/auth.js:** Handle user signup and login using the Supabase client library.  
* **api/create-checkout-session.js (for Stripe):**  
  * Receive the desired license duration (5, 10, or 20 hours) from the frontend.  
  * Use the Stripe Node.js library to create a checkout.session.  
  * Define the line items (product name, price based on hours).  
  * Include success\_url and cancel\_url to redirect the user after payment.  
  * Return the session ID or URL to the frontend.  
* **api/create-paypal-order.js (for PayPal):**  
  * Similar to Stripe, receive license duration.  
  * Use the PayPal Node.js SDK to create an order.  
  * Return the order ID and approval URL to the frontend.  
* **api/stripe-webhook.js:**  
  * Receive events from Stripe.  
  * Verify the webhook signature to ensure it's from Stripe.  
  * Handle the checkout.session.completed event:  
    * Retrieve details about the purchase.  
    * **Generate a unique license key.**  
    * **Create a new record in the licenses table** in Supabase, linking it to the user and setting hours, status, etc.  
    * **Create a record in the transactions table.**  
    * Potentially trigger an email to the user with the license key.  
* **api/paypal-webhook.js:**  
  * Receive events from PayPal (using IPN or Webhooks).  
  * Verify the event is legitimate.  
  * Handle successful payment events:  
    * Retrieve payment details.  
    * **Generate a unique license key.**  
    * **Create records in licenses and transactions tables.**  
    * Send email with license key.  
* **api/validate-license.js:**  
  * Receive license\_key and system\_id from the macOS app.  
  * Query the licenses table in Supabase for the given key.  
  * Check if the license exists and is 'active'.  
  * If linked\_system\_id is null, update the license record with the provided system\_id.  
  * If linked\_system\_id is not null, check if the provided system\_id matches the stored one. If not, return an error (license used on another system).  
  * Check if hours\_remaining is greater than 0\.  
  * Return a response to the macOS app indicating validity and remaining hours, or an error message.  
* **api/report-usage.js:**  
  * Receive license\_key and minutes\_used from the macOS app.  
  * Query the licenses table for the key.  
  * If the license is active and valid for the system (optional check, or rely on validate-license first), decrement hours\_remaining based on minutes\_used. Be careful with floating point precision or use a numeric type.  
  * Return a success or error response.

**Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information like API keys (Supabase URL/Anon Key, Stripe Secret Key, PayPal Client ID/Secret) as Environment Variables in your Vercel project settings. **NEVER** hardcode these in your code.  
**7\. Payment Gateway Integration**

* **Stripe:** Follow Stripe's documentation for integrating Checkout or the Payment Intents API. You'll need to install the Stripe Node.js library in your Vercel function project (npm install stripe).  
* **PayPal:** Follow PayPal's documentation for integrating their REST API. Install a PayPal Node.js SDK (npm install @paypal/checkout-server-sdk or similar).

**8\. License Generation and One-User/System Logic**

* **License Generation:** In your payment webhook functions, use a library to generate a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). This is a standard way to get a highly unique string. In Node.js: const { v4: uuidv4 } \= require('uuid'); const licenseKey \= uuidv4();. Install the uuid library (npm install uuid).  
* **One User/System Logic:** This is handled in the api/validate-license.js function as described in step 6\. The linked\_system\_id column in your Supabase licenses table is key here.

**Getting macOS System Identifier:**  
In your macOS app (Swift or Objective-C), you can use the IOKit framework to access hardware properties like the platform UUID.  
import Foundation  
import IOKit

func getSystemUUID() \-\> String? {  
    let platformExpert \= IOServiceGetMatchingService(kIOMasterPortDefault, IOServiceMatching("IOPlatformExpertDevice"))

    if platformExpert \== 0 {  
        print("Could not get platform expert device")  
        return nil  
    }

    guard let uuidCF \= IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperty(platformExpert, kIOPlatformUUIDKey as CFString, kCFAllocatorDefault, 0\) else {  
        print("Could not get platform UUID property")  
        IOObjectRelease(platformExpert)  
        return nil  
    }

    let uuid \= uuidCF.takeRetainedValue() as? String

    IOObjectRelease(platformExpert)

    return uuid  
}

// Example usage in your macOS app:  
// if let systemID \= getSystemUUID() {  
//     print("System UUID: \\(systemID)")  
//     // Use this systemID when calling your backend validation endpoint  
// } else {  
//     print("Failed to get system UUID")  
//     // Handle the error appropriately in your app  
// }
