### 8. UI/UX & Optimization (June 2025)
- [x] Dashboard logout now shows a success message on the main page
- [x] License key is now displayed with copy and visibility toggle
- [x] Main page is now a client component for logout message
- [x] E2E tests and UI are being aligned for license and usage flows
- [ ] Enhancement: For optimal performance, consider moving the logout message to a small client component instead of making the whole main page a client component
- [ ] Add E2E and UI handling for revoked licenses (disable usage tracking, show clear error)

## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Implement E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Add performance tests
- [ ] Test error scenarios comprehensively
- [ ] Add load testing for API endpoints

- [ ] Implement license validation in app
- [ ] Add usage tracking
- [ ] Create system ID generation
- [ ] Handle offline scenarios
- [ ] Test cross-platform compatibility

### 3. Infrastructure & Security
- [ ] Set up separate development/production environments
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure CORS policies
- [ ] Add API authentication middleware
- [ ] Implement request validation
- [ ] Set up error monitoring service

## Recent Changes & Rationale

### E2E Test Account Standardization (May 2025)
- **What:**
  - Standardized all E2E and integration tests to use only two test accounts:
    - `licensed@example.com` (active license, password: `Test1234`)
    - `nolicense@example.com` (expired license, password: `Test1234`)
  - Updated E2E test files to use these accounts exclusively.
  - Updated API documentation and test data to match.
- **Why:**
  - Ensures consistency and reliability in E2E testing.
  - Simplifies debugging and onboarding for new developers.
  - Reduces test flakiness due to mismatched credentials or test data.
  - Makes it easier to maintain and extend the test suite in the future.

## 2025-05-08
- **Completed**: Refined `track_usage` Supabase DB function:
    - Added `p_system_id` parameter for system binding.
    - Implemented validation against `licenses.linked_system_id`.
    - Added logging of usage events to the new `license_usage` table.
    - Ensured `license_usage.minutes_used` column is `NUMERIC` for accurate tracking.
    - Rigorously tested the updated function, including successful and failed scenarios (wrong system ID, etc.) and verified `license_usage` table logging.
- **Completed**: Implemented and tested Row Level Security (RLS) policies for `licenses`, `transactions`, and `license_usage` tables.
    - Ensured users can only read their own data.
    - Restricted direct DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) operations, enforcing data modification through `SECURITY DEFINER` functions.
    - Verified RLS for `SELECT` on the `licenses` table.

## 2025-05-08 (Session Continued)

### Summary:
Completed RLS SELECT testing for `transactions` and `license_usage` tables, confirming they function as expected. Successfully implemented and tested the `/api/licenses/track-usage` API endpoint. This involved:
- Updating the API route to use the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for RPC calls.
- Correcting RPC parameter names to match the SQL function definition (`p_license_key`, `p_system_id`, `p_minutes_used`).
- Modifying `src/middleware.ts` to exclude `/api/licenses/track-usage` from session-based authentication, allowing calls from the macOS app (simulated via `curl`).
- Verifying successful usage tracking, insertion into `license_usage` table, and update of `hours_remaining` in the `licenses` table.

### Key Accomplishments:
- **RLS SELECT Tests:**
  - Verified `SELECT` RLS for `transactions` table.
  - Verified `SELECT` RLS for `license_usage` table.
- **Track-Usage API Endpoint (`/api/licenses/track-usage`):
  - Route handler corrected and robustly tested.
  - Middleware configured appropriately for this endpoint.
  - End-to-end test (curl -> Next.js API -> Supabase RPC -> DB update) successful.

### Blockers:
- None.

### Next Steps from Detailed Plan:
- Task 5: Implement Email Delivery of License Keys (Post-Payment).
- Phase 2: Adapt macOS App to Server-Authoritative Model.

Would you like me to proceed with any of these next steps?
